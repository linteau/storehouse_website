			<h2> Why Donate?</h2>
		<p>The Storehouse Food Pantry in Morehead City, NC serves over 700 families,
			 which is over 2000 individuals, every month.
			  This would not be possible without the community partnering with us with
				food and monetary donations. There are a lot of operation expenses such as
				utilities, transportation cost, as well as the cost of food we purchase
				from other Food Banks. Without your food and monetary donations, we wouldn't
				be able to serve the people in our community. <b><u>We are 501(c)3.</u></b>
