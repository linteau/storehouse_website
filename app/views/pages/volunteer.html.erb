        <h2> Volunteer with Us!</h2>
      <p>Feeding over 700 families monthly is not an easy task and can only be accomplished by a commited group of people who want to server their community. Without the help from our volunteers the food would never make it to the food pantry, it would not be sorted and packed, and there would be no one to hand it out during distribution days. As our ministry is growing monthly, we are always looking for volunteers. Read on to learn about the different ways you can volunteer with us.
